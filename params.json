Tying in with other levels brings benefits but also challenges: Takes longer, but makes more sense.\r\n\r\n## Benefits\r\n\r\n- alignment with organisational scope, strategy, vision\r\n- joint resources - more knowledge and resources, bigger picture, better understanding\r\n\r\n## Challenges\r\n\r\n- joint timelines = longer TTP\r\n- scope creep\r\n\r\n# Strategy\r\n\r\nANDS capability maturity framework defines maturity levels of Research Data Management.\r\n\r\n- Turtle Program and Marine Science are L2-3\r\n- Division and Department are L1-2, but are taking up lessons learned from Marine Science\r\n- Needs: Management buy-in, recognising data as our digital currency\r\n- Opportunities: Invest in staff, train the trainers, 1:20 principle\r\n\r\n# Demo\r\n\r\n- Projects are documented, approved, reported on in [SDIS](https://sdis.dpaw.wa.gov.au/)\r\n- Turtle Data Management tasks are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/florianm/turtle-planning) with a [Kanban board](https://waffle.io/florianm/turtle-planning)\r\n- Datasets are registered in the [Data catalogue](http://internal-data.dpaw.wa.gov.au/) - DPaW Intranet only.\r\n- Spatial data (a subset of all data on the catalogue) is discoverable on the [internal map viewer](https://internal-map.dpaw.wa.gov.au/).\r\n- Datasets are registered with spatial extent, plus links to data\r\n- \"insight-to-go\" = data + analysis + product as additional trading unit of insight\r\n- Specialised data management solutions feed into / are linked from the catalogue\r\n- Data-driven reports and apps (dashboards) deliver real-time insight\r\n\r\n# Timeline\r\n\r\n- Data catalogue: Implemented 2013, adapting to evolving data mgmt needs since then\r\n- DPaW Marine Science provided the template for the WA State govt catalogue data.wa.gov.au, announced July 2015, launched March 2015\r\n- Data classification, publishing: working on getting departmental stakeholders on board with idea (ongoing since 2013)\r\n- Data collection: collaboration with DPaW GIS Applications developers, evaluating various solutions\r\n- Tagging: WAMTRAM 2 to be overhauled/replaced by integrated Biol Survey DB Biosys\r\n- Stranding: Acquisition in process for StrandNet\r\n- Tracks: WALIS's \"Managing Coastal Vulnerability\" Team has produced an [Aerial Survey DM solution](http://dpaw.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=3676bf05ab21499ab44abadcb87c10b9) - restricted access\r\n",
