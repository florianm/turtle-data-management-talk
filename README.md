# DIKW pyramid

NWSFTCP's data management framework aims to

- make data discoverable and accessible,
- automate the extraction of information from data,
- make the process of inferring knowledge into the extracted information transparent and defensible, in order to
- deliver decision-ready insight to answer our stakeholders' management questions, and to
- disseminate insight as per our communications plan.

# Scope

The NWSFBTP data management is embedded in a nested scope:

- Turtle group (9 staff)
- Marine Science Program (~20 staff)
- Science and Conservation Division (~300 staff)
- Department of Parks and Wildlife (~1600 staff, about 400 data producers)
- WA State Government (120+ Departments)

The NWSFBTP interacts with each level by jointly working on a number of data management challenges. Tying in with other levels brings benefits but also challenges: Takes longer, but makes more sense.

## Benefits

- alignment with organisational scope, strategy, vision
- joint resources - more knowledge and resources, bigger picture, better understanding

## Challenges

- joint timelines = longer TTP
- scope creep

# Strategy

ANDS capability maturity framework defines maturity levels of Research Data Management.

- Turtle Program and Marine Science are L2-3
- Division and Department are L1-2, but are taking up lessons learned from Marine Science
- Needs: Management buy-in, recognising data as our digital currency
- Opportunities: Invest in staff, train the trainers, 1:20 principle

# Demo

- Projects are documented, approved, reported on in [SDIS](https://sdis.dpaw.wa.gov.au/)
- Turtle Data Management tasks are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/florianm/turtle-planning) with a [Kanban board](https://waffle.io/florianm/turtle-planning)
- Datasets are registered in the [Data catalogue](http://internal-data.dpaw.wa.gov.au/) - DPaW Intranet only.
- Spatial data (a subset of all data on the catalogue) is discoverable on the [internal map viewer](https://internal-map.dpaw.wa.gov.au/).
- Datasets are registered with spatial extent, plus links to data
- "insight-to-go" = data + analysis + product as additional trading unit of insight
- Specialised data management solutions feed into / are linked from the catalogue
- Data-driven reports and apps (dashboards) deliver real-time insight

# Timeline

- Data catalogue: Implemented 2013, adapting to evolving data mgmt needs since then
- DPaW Marine Science provided the template for the WA State govt catalogue data.wa.gov.au, announced July 2015, launched March 2015
- Data classification, publishing: working on getting departmental stakeholders on board with idea (ongoing since 2013)
- Data collection: collaboration with DPaW GIS Applications developers, evaluating various solutions
- Tagging: WAMTRAM 2 to be overhauled/replaced by integrated Biol Survey DB Biosys
- Stranding: Acquisition in process for StrandNet
- Tracks: WALIS's "Managing Coastal Vulnerability" Team has produced an [Aerial Survey DM solution](http://dpaw.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=3676bf05ab21499ab44abadcb87c10b9) - restricted access
