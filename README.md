# DIKW pyramid

NWSFTCP's data management framework aims to

- make data discoverable and accessible,
- automate the extraction of information from data,
- make the process of inferring knowledge into the extracted information transparent and defensible, in order to
- deliver decision-ready insight to answer our stakeholders' management questions.

Our communication plan (comms plan) governs the bigger picture of knowledge transfer and uptake.

# Scope

The NWSFBTP data management is embedded in a nested scope:

- Turtle group (9)
- Marine Science Program (~20)
- Science and Conservation Division (~300)
- Department of Parks and Wildlife (~1600)
- WA State Government (120+ Departments)

The NWSFBTP interacts with each level by jointly working on a number of data management challenges. Tying in with other levels brings benefits but also challenges.

## Benefits

- align with organisational scope, strategy, vision
- joint resources - more brain (subject matter experts provide their experience) and muscle (funding and resources)

## Challenges

- joint timelines have longer TTP (time to production)
- scope creep has to be managed

# Strategy

ANDS capability maturity framework defines maturity levels of Information Management capability.

- MSP is L2-3
- Dept is L1-2
- Needs: Management buy-in, recognising data as our digital currency
- Opportunities: Invest in staff, train the trainers, 1:10 principle

# Slide 4: Demo

- Datasets are registered in the Data catalogue (metadata on datasets).
- Spatial data (a subset of all data on the catalogue) is discoverable on the internal map viewer.

- Datasets are registered with spatial extent, plus links to data

- "insight-to-go" = data + analysis + product as additional trading unit of insight

- Specialised data management solutions feed into / are linked from the catalogue

- Data-driven reports and apps (dashboards) deliver real-time insight

# Slide 5: Timeline

- Data catalogue: Implemented 2013, adapting to evolving data mgmt needs since then
- DPaW Marine Science provided the template for the WA State govt catalogue data.wa.gov.au, announced July 2015, launched March 2015
- Tagging: WAMTRAM 2 to be overhauled/replaced by integrated Biol Survey DB Biosys, RA for tagging starting July 2016
- Stranding: Acquisition in process for StrandNet
- Tracks: WALIS's "Managing Coastal Vulnerability" Team has produced DM approach
- Data classification, publishing: working on getting departmental stakeholders on board with idea (ongoing since 2013)
- Data collection: collaboration with DPaW GIS Applications developers, evaluating various solutions
